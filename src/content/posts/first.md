Hello! I'm Daniel, and this is my dev journal/journal! â€“ since I started giving shape to this I still can't figure out which. As I begun a more... lets say, aggressive... journey into becoming a successful developer, I realized that it would be interesting to register some stuff on the way.
So, this website will be a place to share thoughts I find interesting ðŸ¤”, maybe challenges I encounter on what I am currently working ðŸ¤“, and finally, of course, some silly stuff ðŸ¤©.

If you are here, on this post, you probably, I think, came from my portfolio. But, in case you didn't, here is a link to it: [*awesome portfolio*](https://danielx-art.github.io/portfolio/).

And If you want to contact me, asks questions, share thoughts yourself, offer me an incredible job (I love you too), you can contact me first via e-mail [*daniel.rangel.guedes@gmail.com*](mailto:daniel.rangel.guedes@gmail.com)

Now, as an introduction for my dev ways, let me present tech about this website.

## Experience design and layout decisions
- Very clean: almost no visual distractions or buttons;
- Very objective: no fun allowed, we are here for the words on the screen â€“ just kidding â€“ focused on showing and finding content related to my dev experience and endeavours;
- Soft grainy texture on the back to be that visual brown noise and *bring up that zen*;

## Tech decisions and design too
- Astro.js: This is not a app nor a dashboard nor a platform nor a enterprise solution nor social media, this is just a digital notebook, with minimum interactions by design and not much compleexity, so Astro is very quick and easy for both me as the dev and the reader, and it is focused on content without compromising on criativity, so perfect!
- A sprinkle of SEO (perâ€‘page meta tags, canonical links, and hreflang alternate links);
- The same (visually) nav bar and color pallete I have on my portfolio: **I like consistency**, I like **theme switching**, my mother language in **brazilian** portuguese, I like a **home button**;
- Searching, of course;
- Pagination â€“ at least the basics to keep things tighty â€“, of course;
- MDX support: I have some plans, of course;
- Code formatting with rehype/shinki: we will be writing about code, of course;
- Math, with Katex + rehype/remark: beacause I like LaTeX, I have a bachelor in Physics, I love Math, I am nerdy, leave me alone (don't);
- Tailwind CSS: because its too weird when there is not;
- React: because its easy client stuff and Astro has an easy integration with it, and also because I just like it and I am familiar with it;
- Some accessibility, though aria labels and keyboard shortcuts: because any excuse to learn or incorporate accessibility is very welcome.

And finally, you too, be welcome!

â€” Daniel
